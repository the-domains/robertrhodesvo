Robert "Hollywood" Rhodes

Hollywood got his nick-name because of his velvet voice and his movie star charm. From Boston to New Orleans to the Big Apple, the black Clark Gable of the airwaves has worked at some of today's premier music outlets. Hollywood is also a top notch voice over artist. His voice has enhanced the production values of WJLB Detroit, WBLS New York, KSOC/KBFB Dallas and VH1\.
